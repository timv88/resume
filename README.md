# My Résumé
This is my résumé built with vanilla HTML & CSS. It was built with PDF conversion and printing in mind. [Demo](https://timv88.github.io/resume).

## Stuff I used

- [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Material Icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline)
- [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/)

## Browser Support

I have only been tested this in Chrome 75 (Windows). I don't intend on adding legacy browser support or fixing cross browser issues.
