# My Résumé

This is my résumé built with vanilla HTML & CSS. It was built with PDF conversion and printing in mind. [Demo](https://timv88.github.io/resume).

## PDF Conversion

Ensure you have margins set to 0 and `background graphics` enabled. 

I have only been tested this in Chrome 75 (Windows). I don't intend on adding support for other browsers.

## Stuff I used

- [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to fix inconsistent user agent styles
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to improve upon those boring system fonts
- [Material Icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline) and [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) because they look good
